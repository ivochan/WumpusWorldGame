    <!-- GameInfoActivity Elements-->
    <string name="game_info">Inspired by \"<b>Hunt the Wumpus</b>\" video game,
        created by <b>Gregory Yob</b>, this game app realizes two game modes,
        so, my dear player, you can impersonate
        a brave adventurer, or a mysterious creature.
        \n\nIf you\'ll be in the shoes of the <b>Adventurer</b>,
        you should avoid to fall into the ditches, to be devoured by the monster
        and also to find out its immense treasure!
        \n\nInstead, if you are the mysterious <b>Wumpus</b>,
        the creature\'s hiding in the depths of the gloomy forest,
        you should run away from the hunter who is hard on your heels,
        avoiding his traps and find out the secret passage
        that will lead you to salvation.
        \n\nBy the way, whether you are the Wumpus or the Adventurer, enjoy yourself!
        \n\nUh, I\'ve almost forgot ...
        \nIf you\'re lazy enough to gain the \"High Armchair Award\"
        let me play for you using automatic game mode!
